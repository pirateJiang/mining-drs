"""
Generic data point for data yielded by DataSource.

Note on alternatives:
If you prefer standard Python semantics, you could potentially bypass `DataSource` entirely 
and use a plain Python generator (e.g. `yield DataPoint(...)`). However, the `DataSource` 
class is retained to seamlessly integrate with `Module`, making it a first-class citizen 
in the simulation graph and tracking execution contexts and telemetry.
